# Simple Surfing Game

A simple surfing game made for the 2017 Global Game Jam.  The main character's sprite was taken from Spriter Pro's assets, and therefore I'm not certain if I'm allowed to upload it here so I may have to change this in the future.  This game also has music made by Kevin Macleod  This game and the assets were also uploaded here:  https://globalgamejam.org/2017/games/riding-waves

The mouse controls the level of the waves while the player can jump and lean back and forth tp avoid falling over and accumulate points.  There are also some different/weird/dumb artstyle options.

I probably should've removed it or changed it before uploading, but for some reason I think it's funny
